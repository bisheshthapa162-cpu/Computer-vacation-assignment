<p><b>‚ÄúEvery year, I wait for Dashain and Tihar with so much excitement ‚Äî it‚Äôs like the most magical time of the year! From the moment the celebrations start, the whole house feels alive with laughter, bright colors, and the sweet aroma of traditional food. I love wearing my new clothes, helping my family decorate the home, and receiving tika and blessings from elders. The streets are full of lights, flowers, and cheerful faces. For me, Dashain and Tihar are not just festivals; they are moments of joy, togetherness, and unforgettable memories that make me feel proud to be part of such beautiful traditions!‚Äù</b></p>

<p><b>During Dashain, our house becomes a place full of laughter, delicious smells, and family gatherings. I love helping my mom clean and decorate the house with flowers and red tika plates. On the day of Phulpati, we all wear new clothes, and I feel so happy watching my elders put tika and jamara on my forehead while blessing me for success and happiness. Getting Dakshina (money blessings) is also a little exciting part of the day! But most importantly, it feels amazing to see the whole family together, forgetting all worries.
When Tihar arrives, the nights glow beautifully with diyo lamps and colorful lights. Me and my cousins make rangoli designs in front of the house and sing Deusi-Bhailo in our neighborhood. The sparkle of lights, the songs, and the laughter make me feel like the entire world is celebrating with us. My favorite day is Bhai Tika because it‚Äôs the day I get to put tika on my brother‚Äôs forehead and wish him a long, happy life. It‚Äôs such a pure and emotional moment.
Every Dashain and Tihar teaches me something new ‚Äî the joy of togetherness, the beauty of tradition, and the warmth of love. These festivals aren‚Äôt just about rituals; they are about family, happiness, and memories that stay forever in our hearts.</b></p>

    <p><b>As Dashain and Tihar come to an end, I‚Äôm left with a heart full of happiness and memories that will never fade. The laughter of my family, the blessings from my elders, and the sparkle of lights around our home make these festivals truly magical. They remind me how lucky I am to be surrounded by love, culture, and traditions that bring us all together. Every year, Dashain and Tihar teach me to value the warmth of family, the beauty of togetherness, and the simple joys that make life so special.</b></p>
